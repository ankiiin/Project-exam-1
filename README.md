# Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was setting up and structuring API integration. This was solved by using fetch requests and dynamically rendering content based on API responses.

Another challenge was ensuring consistent styling and navigation across multiple pages. This was addressed by organizing CSS files into global and page-specific styles and later improving navigation usability by implementing a sticky navbar.
